<p><b>History:</b>This delcious deep fried finger food originates from Libya, my home country in North Africa. This dish is unique to Libya and is especially popular during special occasions as well as Ramadan. The well seasoned flavours of the meat and the combination of the crispy exterior of the potatoes might make this your new favourite side dish! Like any special home-made North African dish recipes are passed down generationally and typically don't have exact measurment recipes. Below you will find the closest appoximation of measurments to the recipe my mom makes which is dear to my heart. Enjoy and Sahtain (Arabic word for Bon Appetit!)!"    </p>
