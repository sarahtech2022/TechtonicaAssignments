<p class="center"><b>Description:</b>This delcious deep fried finger food originates and is unique to Libya, my home country in North Africa! It's especially popular during special occasions as well as Ramadan. The well seasoned flavours of the meat and the combination of the crispy exterior of the potatoes might make this your new favourite side dish! Like any special home-made North African dish recipes are passed down generationally and typically don't have exact measurment recipes. Below is the closest appoximation of measurments to the recipe my mom makes which is dear to my heart. Enjoy and Sahtain! (Arabic word for Bon Appetit!)"    </p>

        <li>1 cup finely chopped parlsey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 medium onion finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger</li>
        <li>a few pinches of cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon tumeric</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons fine breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 large beaten egg yolks</li>
        <li>Canola oil for frying(or airfryer)</li>

<div>
    <ol class="centerforText">
        <li>Mix together the ground meat with the onions, parsley, cilantro, garlic, all the spices, as well as the egg whites which will help hold the mixture together.</li>
        <li>Start peeling your potatoes!</li>
        <li>The trick to making the little potato pouches that hold the meat is by cutting thick slices of potato with a slit through the middle that doesn't go all the way through! </li>
        <li>Now stuff your potato pouches with the meat filling.</li>
