<p class="center"><b>Description:</b>This delcious deep fried finger food originates and is unique to Libya, my home country in North Africa! It's especially popular during special occasions as well as Ramadan. The well seasoned flavours of the meat and the combination of the crispy exterior of the potatoes might make this your new favourite side dish! North African recipes are passed down generationally and typically don't have exact measurments. Below is the closest appoximation of measurments to the recipe my mother makes.<p class="center">Enjoy and Sahtain! (Arabic word for Bon Appetit!) </p>   </p>

    <h4 class="center">Meat mixture:</h4>
    <ul class="centerforText">
        <li>1.5 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>5-6 large potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped parlsey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 medium onion finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 egg whites</li>
        <li>Preferably use Libyan Spice Mix if available otherwise add:</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger</li>
        <li>a few pinches of cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon tumeric</li>
        <h4 class="center">Coating:</h4>
        <li>4 tablespoons fine breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 large beaten egg yolks</li>
        <li>Canola oil for frying</li>

    </ul>

<div>
    <h4 class="center">  Directions:</h4>
    <ol class="centerforText">
        <li>Mix together the ground meat with the onions, parsley, cilantro, garlic, egg whites, and all the spices.</li>
        <li>Start peeling your potatoes!</li>
        <li>Next make you Imbattan pockets! (The trick to making the little potato pouches that hold the meat is by cutting thick slices of potato with a slit through the middle that doesn't go all the way through!) </li>
        <li>Now stuff your potato pouches with the meat filling.</li>
        <li>Dip in beaten egg yolk mixture then seal the opening edge with the breadcrumbs mixture.</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan of oil aand fry the Imbattan on a medium heat to allow them to cook thoroughly. </li>
        <li>Take your Imbattan out when they are a crispy brown colour. Leave them to dry paper towels.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
